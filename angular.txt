the decorator, which is used to provide Angular with metadata about a
building block, performing a role loosely similar to a C# attribute.

an Angular component is equivalent to an ASP.NET Core MVC controller

an Angular component’s template is equivalent to a Razor view.

The key difference is that the MVC
controllers and views are used to generate a response to an HTTP request, after which they have finished
their job, but an Angular component and its template have an ongoing responsibility to manage the HTML
displayed to the user and respond to user interaction and changes to the data model.

Data bindings incorporate data provided by a controller into a template

<tr><th>Name</th><td>{{product?.name}}</td></tr>
The question mark is the TypeScript safe navigation operator, and it has the same purpose as the
C# equivalent, preventing the name property from being read when the product property has not been
initialized.
